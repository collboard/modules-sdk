/**
 * Here is a brief explanation of what each command does:
 * - "M" or "m" - moveto command, used to move the current position of the cursor to a new location.
 * - "L" or "l" - lineto command, used to draw a straight line from the current position to a new location.
 * - "H" or "h" - horizontal lineto command, used to draw a horizontal line from the current position to a new location.
 * - "V" or "v" - vertical lineto command, used to draw a vertical line from the current position to a new location.
 * - "C" or "c" - curveto command, used to draw a cubic B√©zier curve from the current position to a new location.
 * - "S" or "s" - shorthand/smooth curveto command, used to draw a smooth cubic B√©zier curve from the current position to a new location.
 * - "Q" or "q" - quadratic B√©zier curve command, used to draw a quadratic B√©zier curve from the current position to a new location.
 * - "T" or "t" - shorthand/smooth quadratic B√©zier curveto command, used to draw a smooth quadratic B√©zier curve from the current position to a new location.
 * - "A" or "a" - elliptical arc command, used to draw an elliptical arc from the current position to a new location.
 * - "Z" or "z" - closepath command, used to close the current path.
 *
 * Note: Please note that these commands are case sensitive, so "M" and "m" are different commands.

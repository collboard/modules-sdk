/**
 * Collboard module is basic unit of functionality. From the technical point of view it is just an object or function which will create this object with manifest and setup function that can make some work and returns a logic how to destroy itself.
 *
 * It can be in two forms:
 * 1) **IModuleDefinition** which will directly contain setup and optionally the manifest @see IModuleDefinition
 * 2) Or function that will return IModuleDefinition. This can be usefull to create unique scope before calling the setup.
 *    When the module is uninstalled and than installed again, this factory will be called again so you do not need to think about some complicated scenarios.
 *    Notice that this factory should not do some heavy work or keep something to destroy. Purpose of it is only to define scope variabliles. Heavy work should be done in the setup.
 *
 * Note: We cannot use just a function setup as and module because than we cannot distinguish between factory of full module and just setup
